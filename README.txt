GUI Expression Creator
@Author : Anubhav Bhardwaj

How to Use :

- At the page load for every function in the list, a unique icon will be displayed on screen, captioned with the function name. Additionally, a blank “expression area” is present 
	on the screen into which the user can drag and drop the name icons
- When you drag an icon it will create yet some more expression areas within the parent expression area depending on the number of arguments a function takes
- when drag another icon in the already populated expression area, it will replace the previous expression with the new one.
- ===Recursive Feature=====
	The user can drag more function icons into the new placeholder areas created by dropping of the previous icon. This process can continue recursively indefinitely to create complex 
	chained expressions
